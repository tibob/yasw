\section sect_implement_filter Implement your own filter
In order your own filter, you have to create a class that inherits from BaseFilter and reimplement
- AbstractFilterWidget* getWidget();
- QString getName();
- void recalculate(); as a public slot

Each Filter should be placed in its own folder under the filter folder. Don't forget to
modifiy hte INCLUDEPATH in yasw.pro.

Have a look at the Rotation class (folder filter/rotation) for a simple filter example.
